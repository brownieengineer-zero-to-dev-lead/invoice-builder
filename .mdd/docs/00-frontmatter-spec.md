# Frontmatter Schema Reference

Every `.mdd/docs/*.md` feature doc must start with this YAML frontmatter block.
Doc-generating phases (build, lifecycle, import-spec, plan) must read this file
before writing any frontmatter — never use embedded templates.

## Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique doc ID matching the filename slug (e.g. `01-auth`) |
| `title` | string | Human-readable feature name |
| `edition` | `MDD` or `Both` | Which MDD edition this applies to |
| `depends_on` | string[] | IDs of feature docs this depends on (build order) |
| `relates` | string[] | IDs of docs that co-change with this one (not prerequisite - symmetric hint) |
| `source_files` | string[] | Source files this doc describes (relative to project root) |
| `routes` | string[] | API routes exposed by this feature |
| `models` | string[] | Database models used or defined by this feature |
| `test_files` | string[] | Test files covering this feature |
| `data_flow` | string | `greenfield`, `reads-existing`, `writes-existing`, or `mixed` |
| `last_synced` | date | ISO date when doc was last synced with source code |
| `status` | string | `draft`, `in_progress`, `complete`, or `deprecated` |
| `phase` | string | Build phase: `1`, `2`, `3`, or `all` |
| `mdd_version` | integer | MDD version when doc was last updated |
| `tags` | string[] | Domain concepts, technology names, feature names (no file paths or generic words) |
| `path` | string | Slash-delimited breadcrumb for navigation (e.g. `Auth/Login`) |
| `integration_contracts` | object[] | Contracts this doc consumes from other features |
| `satisfies_contracts` | object[] | Contracts this doc fulfills for other features |
| `security_read_sites` | string[] | Code locations where security-sensitive reads occur |
| `known_issues` | string[] | Known bugs or gaps (append-only - never remove) |
